Project setup https://trello.com/c/yyJEjrQs

Install gradle and create a new project with `gradle init --type java-library`. Run Hello world class and run simple test


Design

Google does three things: collects web pages, indexes them and performs searches on the indexes. We will do the minimum to implement
 the three core things to get a straw-man working, then iterate on what we have built.


- Crawler

The Crawler downloads web pages and for each link it finds in a web page, it download that page, and so on.


- Indexer

The Indexer takes words out of a web page and creates a link to the word and the web page it was found in, just like
a name points to phone numbers in a contact list.
