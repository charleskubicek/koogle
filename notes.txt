Google in Kotlin - Koogle

Project setup https://trello.com/c/yyJEjrQs

Install gradle and create a new project with `gradle init --type java-library`. Run Hello world class and run simple test


Design

Google does three things: collects web pages, indexes them and performs searches on the indexes. We will do the minimum to implement
 the three core things to get a straw-man working, then iterate on what we have built.


- Crawler

The Crawler downloads web pages and for each link it finds in a web page, it download that page, and so on.


- Indexer

The Indexer takes words out of a web page and creates a link to the word and the web page it was found in, just like
a name points to phone numbers in a contact list.


- Searcher

The Searcher lets users type in queries then looks them up in the indexer to return results back.


Iteration 1 - Index one Web Page https://trello.com/c/P9iWVBl8

Start with a simple test, should index one web page. At the moment the Test and the code are in the same class for
ease of making changes. The first failing test expects one word to be returned from the crawler and gets none.
